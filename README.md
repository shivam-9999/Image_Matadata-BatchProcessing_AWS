# Image_Matadata-BatchProcessing_AWS

# for data sets

    I use this github to train my model # https://github.com/gastruc/osv5m

    I read and processed zip files from github and uploaded those processed image files and matadata diectly to cloud

# splitting, batch processing and garbage collection

    for efficiently process images data i use batch processing and files spliting
    also read image files and mata data files
    once reading zip files it can automatically delete zip file from the cloud

# test and train model

    pytorch and numpy files have been trained using cnn network model
